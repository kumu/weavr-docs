# Export

You can directly export your Weavr community data into a Kumu project to run more sophisticated SNA metrics or decorate your map. 

**Some things to note:** 

- You need a [Kumu account](kumu.io) to open a Kumu project (However, viewers of your Kumu project don't necessarily need a Kumu account. More info on collaborating and sharing Kumu maps [here](https://docs.kumu.io/overview/collaboration.html).)
- Your Kumu map will automatically be updated every time you refresh the project/page. 
- You can choose between a [*public* or a *private* project](https://docs.kumu.io/overview/collaboration.html#public-vs-private-projects) 
- If you choose a private project, the $9 fee is already included in your monthly Weavr subscription. You will not have to pay extra for a Kumu project.

Please contact [support@weavr.app](mailto:support@weavr.app) if you wish to integrate your Weavr community with a Kumu project and we'll be happy to set it up for you!
