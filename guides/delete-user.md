# How do I delete a user?

Deleting a user effectively removes them from the community. If they'd want to re-join the community, they'd have to be invited again.

_Please note:_
_- only Admins can remove other users. Community members can only delete their own user (profile)._
_- If you delete your own user your are immediately removed from the community and won't be able to access it again, unless you're invited back into it._

To delete a user: 
1. Navigate to a profile
2. Click on the edit pencil in the top-right corner
3. Choose "Delete User"
