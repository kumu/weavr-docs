# How do I create a welcome message for my community? 

As an admin, you might want to create a post that welcomes your members to the community and/or lays some ground rules for how Weavr is going to be used within your community. You can place such a post on the Noticeboard, which shows up on your community homepage. 

1. To get started, first create the [post](/guides/messages.md) that you'd like your community members to see as soon as they open the Weavr app and land on the community home page. 
2. Once you've saved the message, click on the three dots in the top-right corner and choose "Convert to Notice"
3. You're post will now show up on the Noticeboard of your community's home page, and will be clickable for everyone to read upon entering the app

To remove a post from the Noticeboard, simply repeat step 2 and choose "Convert to Post". Another option is to delete the post, and it will automatically be removed from your Noticeboard.
