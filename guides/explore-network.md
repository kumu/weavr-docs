# Explore Network

Every community members has “interests” listed in their profile, which indicate their skills and/or expertise. We created the Explore Interests page for those wanting a closer look at the interests that make up a community. It allows you to zoom in on max. 5 interests at once. 

To access this visualization, click on the menu icon in the top-left corner of your screen, and then choose Explore Network. 
Pick up to five values that you'd like to show on the map, and Weavr will display any community members that listed those one or more of those interests in their profile. The legend in the bottom-left corner of your screen will help you identify which color (flag) belongs to which interest. You might recognize the [Flags](https://docs.kumu.io/guides/flags.html) from Kumu's network visualization technology. 

To choose other values, click "Edit Values (Interests)" at the top of your screen, and switch to other interests. 

## Filter

You can also choose to filter the members based on a relationship strength: check or uncheck the boxes that say "Show the following connection" to switch between any or all of the relationship strengths.
