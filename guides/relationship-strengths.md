## Default Relationship Strengths
The default relationships strengths in Weavr are:
- We actively collaborate together
- We communicate regularly
- We know of each other

If you're an admin, you can decide to use these default strengths, or you can customize your relationship strengths by editing them. 

## Editing Relationship Strengths
Only the community admin(s) can edit, add, or delete relationship strengths visible in the community profiles. To edit relationship strengths, click on the menu icon in the top-left corner of the app, choose "Community Settings", and switch to the "Relationships" tab. You'll see a list of all relationship strengths that are currently used by your community. 
- Give a value to the relationship strength to determine how they are treated in the Network Analysis section of the Weavr app
- Change the number of the field with the dropdown to change the order in which they show up in a profile
- Use the toggle to delete a relationship strength. Don't forget to hit "Save" at the bottom!

## Deleting a relationship
To delete an existing relationship: go to your Profile, click the edit pencil in the top-right corner and choose "Edit Relationships". 
Simply click on any of the relationships that have a black X sticker on them (below the search bar). 
Don't forget to click "Next" and then "Save" at the bottom of your screen.
