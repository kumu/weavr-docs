# Getting started with Weavr 

Weavr is an online collaboration app developed by the [Kumu](http://kumu.io/) team that helps you build more impactful networks and communities. We’re happy you found us! Below we’ll outline the first steps to get started with your very own Weavr community. 

First and foremost: download the Weavr mobile app from your device’s app store.

[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weavr/id1455882734)

[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.weavr&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1)

## Create a community
After having downloaded the Weavr app, you’ll find the welcome page that invites you to Sign In (for returning users), or to Create a community. To create a new space for your community, click on Create a community and follow the prompted steps to set it up. 

*Please note that you’re asked for your credit card information in step 3 of setting up your own community. If you are unable to do that, or require a demo/trial, please contact us at support@weavr.app*

## Fill out your profile
Click on the image icon on the far right of the bottom menu bar to access your profile. Here, you can edit your profile by clicking on the pencil icon in the top-right corner. Add a picture, fill out your info, and share your interests/skills. Profile information is viewable to everyone in the community!

## Invite your connections
Once you’ve set up your community, it’s time to invite other members to it. There’s three ways to add community members to your freshly setup community: 

- Click on the menu in the top-left corner and choose Invite. This allows you to add a single user with their email address and their names. Your invitee will receive an email in their inbox with a personal signup link. 


- If you prefer to do a bulk upload of all your community members at once, please go to Edit Community in the top-left corner menu and click the Members tab. You’ll find the Bulk Upload button here. 


- The last option is to share a signup link with your contacts. This way, people that want to be added to your community can request this through the signup link. You can decide whether you want to auto-accept requests, or whether you wish to manually accept or reject them. As an admin, you’ll be notified anytime you receive a new join request. You’ll find the signup link on the same Members page as point 2. 

## Update your relationships
After filling out your profile, it’s time to add your relationships! Click on the edit pencil and choose “Edit my relationships” to indicate who you know in the community and how well. The number of Relationship Strengths and their specific text is set by the community admin. 

*Please note that all community members can see your relationships and their strengths.*

## Start posting
Once you’re set up, you can create a Post to send a message to your entire community. Choose the Posts icon in the bottom menu bar of your screen and click on the + sign to add a new post. You can also pre-determine Post Topics (link to post topics) to organize your community’s messages. And finally, perhaps start reaching out to your community members through the direct message functionality!

## Weaving Prompts
Weaving Prompts are the foundational feature of Weavr that allows you to weave your network together and grow a more impactful community. 

Create your very first weaving prompt by clicking on the + button in the top-right corner. Here you can invite two other community members to connect and give a short description of why you think they should connect. 

Weaving prompts will also occasionally push a notification to your phone when your interests, offers or needs align with someone else’s profile. This way, you’ll be prompted to connect with members of your community that you might not have otherwise! 

Find more information about Weaving prompts here (link to Weaving Prompts doc).
