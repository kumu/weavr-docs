# Community Admins & Members

A Weavr community has two types of users: 

- Admin(s)- serve to manage the community and have more "rights" within the app than regular Members 
- Members- any person added to an existing community that is not an Admin, is a Member

## Making someone an Admin
By default, the person that initially created the Weavr community is automatically an Admin. Only Admins can grant other members Admin status. 
To do so, visit any member's profile, click on the edit pencil in the top-right corner, and then choose "Grant Admin Status".

## Revoking someone's Admin status
Only current Admins can revoke Admin status. 
To revert a person from Admin back to Member, visit the admin's profile, click on the edit pencil in the top-right corner, and then choose "Revoke Admin Status".
