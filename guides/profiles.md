# Profiles

Every community member in Weavr has a profile where they can fill out their personal information. 
Profiles are generally viewable by everyone in the community, except for when an admin has enabled hidden fields.

To edit the fields in your profile, first click on the profile icon in the bottom-right corner, then click on the edit pencil in the top-right corner of your profile, and then choose "Edit Profile". Don't forget to hit "Save your fields" at the bottom of your screen when you're done!
*Please note that any fields that you don't fill out, will not show up in your profile after saving.*

If a field isn't filled out, it will not show up in a member's profile.
