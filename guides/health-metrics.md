# Health & Metrics

Admins will have access to a Health & Metrics page that shows them a quick overview of how their community has been adopting the Weavr app.

## Metrics
You'll find the following metrics on your Health & Metrics page: 

- **Total** - total number of members invited into your community, including those that haven't accepted the invite yet
- **Installed** - total number of members that accepted Weavr's Terms of Service, which indicates they accessed Weavr at least once from their mobile phone or from their desktop
- **Installed %** - percentage of Installed (members installed Weavr app) divided by Total (members invited)
- **Updated Profile** - number of active members that updated their profile **(does this include people that have only been invited, but have not signed in yet??)**
- **Added a Relationship** - number of members that added at least one [relationship](/guides/relationship-strengths.md) to their profile
- **Created a Prompt** - number of members that created at least one manual [weaving prompt](/guides/weaving-prompt.md)

## Engagement
This section ranks your community members by Most Engaged and Least Engaged. Now you can praise the community members that are most engaged, and give a gentle nudge to those that are less engaged. 

We calculate Engagement as a function of post engagement: if there are 10 posts in a Weavr community, and a given user has responded or replied to all 10 of them, they're considered 100% engaged.
