# Why can I not sign into Weavr? 

After opening the Weavr app, you'll be prompted to enter your email address. An email will be sent that includes a sign-in link. Clicking the sign-in link will complete the sign-in process and give you access to the community.

*Note: you can only sign into Weavr if you own a community (admin), or you're invited into a community (member). If you're not part of any community, then you won't receive a signin link.*
