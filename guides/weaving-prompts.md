# Weaving Prompts

WIP

Weaving Prompts help your community grow and connect by suggesting new connections between existing community members. 

There's two types of weaving prompts: 
- Automatic: the Weavr app suggests that you connect with someone based on similar interests filled out in member profiles
- Manual: a community member suggests that two other members connect and includes a short note on why
