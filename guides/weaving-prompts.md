# Weaving Prompts

Weaving Prompts help your community grow and connect by suggesting new connections between existing community members. 
Now, everyone can be a network weaver!

A network weaver is someone who is aware of the networks around them, and explicitly works to make them healthier. They do this by:
- Helping people identify their interests and challenges
- Connecting people strategically where thereâ€™s potential for mutual benefit
- Serving as a catalyst for self-organizing groups.
- Weavr makes it easier to empower everyone in your community to strengthen and grow the network. 

**Weavr offers two types of weaving prompts:**

- Automatic: the Weavr app suggests that you connect with someone based on similar interests filled out in member profiles
- Manual: a community member suggests that two other members connect and includes a short note on why
