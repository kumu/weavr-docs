# Billing

We use an automated billing system to accept payments for Weavr communities. Amounts can be billed on either a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to be billed annually, you'll receive one free month.

We handle all payments with full PCI-compliance through Stripe, the industry standard. You can use any credit card that is accepted by Stripe. We do not store any sensitive billing information on our own servers.

To add or change the credit card you use for Weavr, perform the following steps:

- Visit weavr.app on a desktop and sign in
- Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner, or click on the menu in the top-left corner menu and choose "Community Settings"
- On the next page, click on the credit card icon in the upper right corner
- Add or update your card there

*Please note, only admins can add and edit credit card information. If you donâ€™t see the credit card icon, please double check with your community owner whether you have admin rights.*

## Monthly vs Annual billing
If you are on a monthly billing cycle, Weavr will bill your account each month. A Weavr community is $29 per month; which includes unlimited members and all functionalities. 

## Payment Receipts
Our billing system automatically sends a receipt to the email address on file each time a payment is made. From time to time, these receipts might get sent to your email's spam folder; if you don't see a receipt, be sure to check there first.

If you want to change the email address that receipts are sent to, please reach out to us through support@weavr.app

## Cancel my subscription
The subscription to Weavr can only be canceled by closing your community. It will be locked, and you and your community won't be able to access the space anymore. 
If you'd like to cancel your subscription, please send us a request to close at suppport@weavr.io

In a temporary pinch? Please reach out to us. We're happy to explore alternative pricing models with you.
